## Super Modder
### Backing up Configuration

Your a Super Modder. You flash your modem on a daily basis.

To save the Config:
* `sysupgrade -i -b filename.tar.gz` - 
    
To restore the Config:    
* `sysupgrade -f filename.tar.gz`] - restore configuration after firmware reflash

### Decrypting Firmware

See [secr](https://github.com/mswhirl/secr) for details (original code from [here](https://github.com/pedro-n-rocha/secr)). Follow instructions with OSCK from <a href="https://pastelink.net/laft">repository</a>, or extract OSCK from modem, then decrypt firmware. This procedure is safe (no files are overwritten on the modem).

| Model Number | Mnemonic |                        OSCK                                      |

### The Boot Process

To be updated - refer to the <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/process.boot">OpenWrt Boot Process guide</a> as an example for now but don't rely on it.

== <b>The OpenWrt Flash Layout</b>

To be updated - refer to the <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/flash.layout">The OpenWrt Flash Layout guide</a> as an example for now but don't rely on it. eg:

$ root@mygateway:~# cat /proc/mtd
dev:    size   erasesize  name
mtd0: 10000000 00020000 "brcmnand.0"
mtd1: 02c60000 00020000 "rootfs"
mtd2: 05920000 00020000 "rootfs_data"
mtd3: 05000000 00020000 "bank_1"
mtd4: 05000000 00020000 "bank_2"
mtd5: 00020000 00020000 "eripv2"
mtd6: 00040000 00020000 "rawstorage"


== <b>Preinit and Root Mount and Firstboot Scripts</b>

To be updated - refer to the <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/preinit_mount?s[]=overlay">OpenWrt Preinit and Root Mount and Firstboot Scripts guide</a> as an example for now but don't rely on it.


== <b>Backup / Restore without rbi file</b>

Bank_1 is on mtd3 partition and bank_2 is on mtd4. Best to backup to usb to minimise chance of filling storage and bricking device.

Plug in a USB stick and run [`ls -la /mnt/usb`]

$ root@mygateway:~# ls -la /mnt/usb/
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root             0 Jan 16 12:31 .
drwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jan 16 10:55 ..
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            20 Jan 16 12:31 USB-A1 -> /tmp/run/mountd/sda1

* Backup: [`dd if=/dev/mtd[*X*] of=/mnt/usb/USB-A1/mtd[*X*].bin`] (replace [*X*] with 3 or 4)
* Restore: [`mtd write /mnt/usb/USB-A1/mtd[*X*].bin bank_[*Y*]`] (replace [*Y*] with 1 or 2)
           Firmware can be restored to either bank. 

Tiscali firmware (which has no RBI files) is flashed this way to other TG789 devices.


== <b>IPv6 Connection Issue</b>

['Ipv6 is really problematic... On openwrt on this old base it think it's quite broken... Also the configuration depends on the ISP... Hard to fix...'] https://github.com/Ansuel/tch-nginx-gui/issues/114


== <b>BusyBox</b>

The gateway runs <a href="https://busybox.net/about.html">busybox</a>, an embedded linux system with minimalist documentation.

$ root@mygateway:~# busybox --help
BusyBox v1.23.2 (2017-08-22 01:34:50 UTC) multi-call binary.

$ 
        BusyBox is a multi-call binary that combines many common Unix
        utilities into a single executable.  Most people will create a
        link to busybox for each function they wish to use and BusyBox
        will act like whatever it was invoked as.

== <b>ash script</b>

Shell script is ash and best reference found is https://linux.die.net/man/1/ash. In practical terms it can be thought of as stripped down bash script so write bash script and fix the errors for features not supported.
