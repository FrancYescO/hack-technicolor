### Firmware versions and URLs if available

For simplicity, model names are reported here without irrelevant branding codes.

For example "DJA0230TLS", where "TLS" stands for "Telstra", is listed here as simply "DJA0230" since all of them share the same board mnemonic.

Other branding codes you could see worldwide are "TS" for "Telia Sonera", "MYR" for MyRepublic, "TI" for Telecom Italia, "VDF" for Vodafone, and so on. You can safely ignore branding codes.

Type 1/2/3 indicates if it can be rooted directly. Please, **don't miss to specify and keep this important detail updated** whenever you add a new firmware version to this page.**

### What to do if your firmware is not listed here

If you want to get an image of a Technicolor firmware which is not listed here you have two main options:

- Try searching very deeply in the web for the original RBI file. Most ISP's keep all firmwares released via remote upgrade on their server, so you may resort into just guessing the right URL
- Try getting root access on a device currently running the firmware you are looking for and grab a dump of its firmware partitions (banks)

Read further below to get some more useful tips.

If you find another firmware for a Technicolor gateway which is not yet listed, please share it here! Keep an eye on your formatting, follow everyone else's!

### Guessing RBI Firmware URL's

Stock bootloader allows TFTP flashing only with the correct RBI firmware file for the hardware board mnemonic version (something like XXXX-X). 

Firmware filename pattern is ISP specific, so the first thing to do is to find another known one from the same ISP to get a better idea of how it should look like. As you can see from below links, it is often constructed by combining: 

Product Vendor + **Hardware** + CRF + **Firmware**

Using the web interface, advanced view Gateway tile will give you Product Vendor, Hardware Version (aka board mnemonic) and Firmware Version:

```
Global Information
Product Vendor 	 	Technicolor
Product Name 	 	Technicolor TG797n v3
Software Version 	15.3
Firmware Version 	15.53.6469-510-RA
Hardware Version 	DANT-O
```

If the modem is rooted the CRF number can be found in `/rom/etc/config/env`
```
cat /rom/etc/config/env
...
option CONF_VERSION 'CRF483'
...
```

The ISP may have customized firmware version numbers to match their own versioning scheme. If so, check the contents of `/rom/etc/config/versioncusto`.

Once you have guessed it please post it here!

Newer firmware images are often encrypted with a board-specific AES-128 (thus symmetric) key, called OSCK. When flashing via either TFTP or web interface it first decrypt the RBI payload and then flash its contents into one of the internal "banks".

Every firmware image is also authenticated by asymmetric keys used for signing and verifying signature. This second action is performed on boot by the stock bootloader which will fail to boot if the signature verification fails.

### Make a raw device dump

Firmware partitions, called banks, contain **signed** and **read-only** squashfs images that get extracted from RBI files during regular firmware flash or upgrade.
Such images cannot boot on different boards and **do not include any sensitive info** about your own device. Therefore they are totally safe to be shared.
In usual dual-bank devices the two firmware partitions are named `bank_1` and `bank_2`, at least one of them has to contain a valid firmware in order to boot correctly.
To make a full dump of them you can easily use the busybox built-in `dd` command:

```
dd if=/dev/mtd3 of=/tmp/bank_1.dump
dd if=/dev/mtd4 of=/tmp/bank_2.dump
```

Please note the two banks are usually mapped into `mtd3` and `mtd4` respectively, but you should always check yourself by reading contents of `/proc/mtd` from your own device.
