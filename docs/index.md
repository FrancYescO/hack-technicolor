## Hacking Technicolor Gateways

**Warning:** This process is not supported by the manufacturer or supplier of your gateway. 
There is no way of knowing your situation and the process could break your gateway or reduce its security allowing other people into your network. Anyone following this guide accepts full responsibility for the outcomes.

## First Steps

1. Head over to [the Firmware Repository](Firmware%20Repository/) to find out what type of firmware your gateway is on today (may change in future!):
    - Type 1
        - no direct root strategy known (_yet_)
        - easy to downgrade to a directly rootable firmware, if any
        - can be rooted indirectly from Type 2 firmware, if any
    - Type 2
        - direct and easy root strategy is known
        - can be used for indirect root strategies for other firmware Types
    - Type 3
        - no direct root strategy known (_yet_)
        - a little hard to downgrade to a directly rootable firmware, if any
        - can be rooted indirectly from Type 2 firmware, if any
    - Type ???
        - no known direct root strategy tested yet, some of them may work just fine
        - may be hard, but still possible, to downgrade to a directly rootable firmware, if any
        - could be rooted indirectly from Type 2 firmware, if any
        - no experience has been shared from users on such firmware, if you think you know something more about that please tell

2. Once you understood your current situation:
    - If you are on a Type 1 or 2 firmware, please see [Type 1 & 2 firmwares](Hack%20Type%201&2/) rooting guides.
    - If you are on a Type 3 firmware, and a Type 2 firmware is available, please see the [recovery](Recovery/) guide to flash a root-friendly firmware.
    - If you are on a Type ??? firmware, it's almost up to you, maybe asking for some help will get you some good hints.
