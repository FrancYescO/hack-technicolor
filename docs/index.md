## Hacking Technicolor Gateways

**Disclaimer:** This process is not supported by the manufacturer or supplier of your gateway.
There is no way of knowing your situation and the process could break your gateway or reduce its security, allowing other people into your network. Anyone following this guide accepts full responsibility for the outcomes.

## Preliminary Steps

You need to know something more about your current firmware. Head over to [the Firmware Repository](Firmware%20Repository/) to find out what "type" of firmware your gateway is on today and read the following appropriate section. We conventionally define three different types, each requiring different actions to be taken

### Type 1

- No direct root strategy known (*yet*).
- Easy to downgrade to a directly rootable firmware, if any.
- Can be rooted indirectly from Type 2 firmware, if any.

### Type 2

- Direct and easy root strategy is known.
- Can be used for indirect root strategies for other firmware Types.

### Type 3

- No direct root strategy known (*yet*)
- Hard to downgrade to a directly rootable firmware, if any.
- Can be rooted indirectly from Type 2 firmware, if any.

### Type ???

- No known direct root strategy tested yet, some of them may work just fine
- May be hard, but still possible, to downgrade to a directly rootable firmware, if any.
- Could be rooted indirectly from Type 2 firmware, if any.
- No experience has been shared from users on such firmware, if you think you know something more about that please tell us.

## Where to start

Once you understand your current situation

- If you are on a Type 1 or 2 firmware, please see [Hack Type 1 and 2.](Hack%20Type%201&2/)
- If you are on a Type 3 firmware, and a Type 2 firmware is available, please see the [recovery](Recovery/) guide to flash it.
- If you are on a Type ??? firmware, you may need to ask for some help on the [thread](https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/9vxxl849).
